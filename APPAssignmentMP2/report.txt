Tiled Matrix Multiplication

    In your kernel implementation, how many threads can be simultaneously executing
    on a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, which contains 20 Streaming Multiprocessors. Use
    nvcc --ptxas-options="-v" matrixmul_kernel.cu to see the resource usage of 
    your kernel (although compilation will fail, it will only do so after
    compiling the kernel and displaying the relevant information.)

Machine Name :gpulab10
After execution of the command  nvcc -Xptxas -v matrixmul_kernel.cu --gpu-architecture=sm_61
the following parameters are used in the Cuda occupancy calculator
Smversion=sm_6.1(computecapability6.1)
Threads per block:256(16 TileWidth)
Registers per Thread:23
Shared memory perblock(bytes) :2048
each SM contains 2048 Active threads.
So number of threads that can be simultaneously executed is NoofSM * NoofActiveThreadsperSM 
=20*2048
=40960.
